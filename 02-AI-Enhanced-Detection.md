# Generative AI Meets Incident Response

## What is Incident Response (IR)?
Incident response (IR) is the process organizations use to **prepare for, detect, contain, eradicate, and recover** from cyberattacks.  
- IR reduces harm from incidents.  
- It provides lessons learned to prevent or better handle future attacks.  
- It is a **continuous cycle** of preparation, response, and improvement.  

### Classic IR Phases
1. **Preparation** – Plan, train, and set up resources.  
2. **Detection & Analysis** – Identify, confirm, and investigate incidents.  
3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery** – Stop the attack, remove threats, and restore systems.  
4. **Post-Incident Activity** – Reflect, document, and improve future responses.

## How Generative AI Enhances IR
Gen AI can speed up and improve each phase of IR by:
- **Log Summarization** – Condenses thousands of logs into clear summaries of threat activity.  
- **Anomaly Detection** – Identifies patterns and suspicious activity in real time.  
- **Automated Recommendations** – Suggests containment and mitigation steps based on prior incidents and observed data.  
- **Report Drafting** – Produces structured post-incident reports for compliance and review.

## Example: Ransomware Incident
- **Deepa**, an IR specialist, uses a gen AI assistant during a ransomware attack.  
- The AI processes thousands of intrusion detection logs, highlighting infection points.  
- It recommends isolating affected endpoints (laptops, servers, printers, etc.).  
- This allows Deepa’s team to **focus on investigation and strategy**, while AI automates repetitive analysis.  

---

## Key Takeaway
Generative AI strengthens incident response by:
- Reducing time spent on repetitive log review,  
- Enhancing real-time detection,  
- Supporting human decision-making,  
- And improving post-incident documentation.  

# Detecting and Containing Threats with Generative AI

Generative AI enhances incident response (IR) across **detection, containment, and post-incident activity** by automating analysis, classification, and documentation.

## Phase 2: Detection & Analysis
**Scenario:** Deepa receives an alert about unusual outbound traffic from a company database.  

### Log Summarization
- Traditional method: Manually review 50,000+ log lines or use keyword filters.  
- Gen AI: Summarizes logs into plain language, highlighting:  
  - 3 GB data transfer from a sensitive database.  
  - Data sent to 12 unknown IPs in Eastern Europe.  
  - Activity occurred 9:00–10:00 AM.  

### Anomaly Explanation
- Gen AI explains why activity is abnormal:  
  - Normal traffic ≈150 MB/day vs 3 GB transfer.  
  - Foreign IPs never accessed the database before.  
  - Activity outside normal business hours.  
  - User account (sgordek) never accessed DB before and used unusual commands.  

### Incident Classification
- Prompt: *“What type of incident is this?”*  
- Gen AI classifies it as **data exfiltration**.  
- Explains likely attack sequence: credential compromise → command-line execution → data transfer.  
- Provides possible attacker techniques.

## Phase 3: Containment, Eradication & Recovery
**Containment Guidance**
- Gen AI suggests next steps:  
  - Isolate affected host (192.168.10.45).  
  - Revoke/reset compromised credentials.  
  - Block malicious external IPs at the firewall.  
- Deepa completes containment in 10 minutes.  

**Note:** Gen AI is most reliable for containment.  
- **Eradication** (malware removal, registry edits) and **Recovery** (backup restoration) still require human expertise.  

---

## Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity
**Documentation Assistance**
- Gen AI drafts a detailed incident report, including:  
  - Timeline and root cause.  
  - Steps taken (containment, eradication, recovery).  
  - Recommended updates (e.g., faster SIEM alerts for data transfers).  
- Deepa edits for accuracy and delivers the report quickly.  

---

## Conclusion
- Traditional resolution time: several hours.  
- With Gen AI assistant: **incident resolved within 1 hour**.  
- Benefits: Faster detection, efficient containment, reduced analyst workload, and improved IR documentation.  

# Keeping Humans Involved in Incident Response

Generative AI can **enhance** incident response (IR) by automating repetitive tasks, but it **cannot replace** human expertise.  
Human judgment, contextual awareness, and oversight are essential to ensure safe and accurate outcomes.

## Limitations of Gen AI in IR

### 1. Hallucinations
- Gen AI may generate **plausible but incorrect guidance**.  
- *Example:* Suggested a non-existent Linux command during malware containment, which could have broken automation scripts.

### 2. Detection Bias
- Outputs may be skewed if training data **overrepresents certain threats**.  
- *Example:* Misclassified an external attack as insider misuse due to biased training data.

### 3. Lack of Real-Time Adaptability
- Models struggle to adapt to **new or emerging threats** without retraining.  
- *Example:* Continued failure to classify external attacks correctly until retrained with more diverse data.

### 4. Invalid Summaries
- Gen AI may produce **incomplete or misleading log summaries**.  
- *Example:* Ignored follow-up commands that revealed privilege escalation, nearly leading to a major breach.

## Human Oversight is Essential
To ensure effective and safe IR, human responders must:
- **Validate** AI outputs against trusted external threat intelligence.  
- **Supervise** AI-supported containment, eradication, and recovery.  
- **Retain final authority** over high-stakes decisions.  
- **Refine prompts** to improve AI performance.

## Key Takeaway
Generative AI is a **powerful assistant** in incident response but requires **human expertise** to verify outputs, manage risks, and make final decisions.
