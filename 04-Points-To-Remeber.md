# Points to Remember

## Key Concepts
1. **Gen AI models** learn from past data to detect new or evolving threat patterns, reducing manual rule updates and repetitive tasks.  
2. **Gen AI features in cybersecurity** include:  
   - Log summarization  
   - Incident classification  
   - Anomaly detection  
   - Chat-based security support  
3. Adding gen AI to **incident response (IR)** speeds up detection, augments decision-making, and automates repetitive tasks.  
4. Helpful gen AI features for IR include:  
   - Log summarization  
   - Anomaly explanation  
   - Incident classification  
   - Containment guidance  
   - Documentation assistance  
5. **Sector-specific applications**: Healthcare, financial, and public sectors can train gen AI to address their unique compliance and threat challenges.  
6. **Watsonx** can enhance IR by analyzing logs, identifying patterns, and suggesting containment steps.
