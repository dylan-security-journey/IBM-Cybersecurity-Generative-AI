# Cybersecurity Challenges Across Sectors

Generative AI (gen AI) can enhance cybersecurity by **identifying, labeling, tracking, and reacting to threats**.  
However, each sector faces **unique challenges and threats**, often tied to regulatory or operational requirements.

---

## Healthcare Sector
### Challenges
- Protecting **sensitive patient data** (diagnoses, test results, prescriptions, insurance).  
- Ensuring compliance with **HIPAA** and other healthcare data regulations.  

### Key Threats
- **Ransomware** targeting hospitals for high-impact extortion.  
- **Insider threats** from employees with broad access to PHI.  
- **Phishing attacks** exploiting vulnerable systems.  

**Example:**  
Northwind Community Hospital integrated digital records into one platform.  
- Their gen AI system detected a surge in foreign login attempts.  
- By correlating logins with threat reports, it identified a phishing attack on a supplier.  
- The team suspended user accounts and restricted vendor access to PHI.  

---

## Financial Sector
### Challenges
- Detecting **fraud across multiple systems** and organizations.  
- Complying with **PCI-DSS** to secure transactions.  

### Key Threats
- **Phishing campaigns** for credential theft and fraud.  
- **Account takeover** due to weak authentication.  
- **Synthetic identity fraud**, blending real and AI-generated data to bypass verification.  

---

## Public Sector
### Challenges
- Protecting **critical infrastructure** (utilities, election systems, emergency comms).  
- Addressing risks from **legacy technologies** still in use.  
- Complying with laws on **transparency and data preservation**.  

### Key Threats
- **Nation-state attackers** targeting public infrastructure.  
- **Supply chain threats** to critical resources.  
- **Third-party software vulnerabilities**.  
- **Insider threats** from employees with privileged access.  

---

## Key Takeaway
While all sectors face common threats (e.g., ransomware, phishing), the **impact and compliance requirements differ**:  
- Healthcare → Patient privacy & HIPAA.  
- Finance → Fraud detection & PCI-DSS.  
- Public → National infrastructure & legacy system risks.  

Generative AI must be **carefully trained and applied** to meet each sector’s unique security and regulatory needs.


# Tailored Generative AI Solutions

Different sectors face unique cybersecurity problems, and generative AI (gen AI) can be **trained to provide sector-specific solutions**.  
Here are examples of how gen AI assists in **healthcare, finance, and public sector** security challenges.

---

## Healthcare Sector
**Problem:** Insurance company must comply with federal regulations to protect patient records.  
**Gen AI Solution:** Summarize access logs and flag suspicious logins.  

**Problem:** Pharmacy must comply with federal controlled substance reporting regulations.  
**Gen AI Solution:** Generate audit-ready log summaries of dispensed medications.  

---

## Financial Sector
**Problem:** Credit card company must respond quickly to transaction fraud.  
**Gen AI Solution:** Recognize and classify suspicious transaction patterns using past fraud data and trigger escalation steps.  

**Problem:** National bank must interpret and share phishing alert data across branches.  
**Gen AI Solution:** Summarize threat reports and recommend protective actions.  

---

## Public Sector
**Problem:** Military branch must monitor software supply chain for vulnerabilities.  
**Gen AI Solution:** Summarize vendor patch notes and automatically tag risks.  

**Problem:** Legislature must comply with transparency laws for incident response across agencies.  
**Gen AI Solution:** Draft reports from shared logs and agency communications.  

---

## Key Takeaway
Generative AI can deliver **tailored solutions** for sector-specific compliance and security needs by:  
- Automating log analysis and reporting,  
- Detecting and classifying threats,  
- Summarizing threat intelligence,  
- And improving transparency.  

⚠️ However, each solution must balance the **benefits** with the **risks and limitations** of using gen AI in sensitive, regulated environments.

# Risks and Considerations of Generative AI in Cybersecurity

While generative AI (gen AI) offers sector-specific benefits, organizations must carefully address **regulatory, ethical, and technical factors**.  
Failing to do so can lead to vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and delayed responses.

---

## Key Risks & Considerations

### 1. Regulatory Noncompliance
- Using **external AI services** can expose sensitive data.  
- *Example:* Entering patient data into an external chatbot could violate **HIPAA**.  

### 2. Data Bias
- Models trained on **imbalanced data** may misclassify activity.  
- *Example:* Legitimate financial transactions flagged unfairly as fraud.  

### 3. Lack of Explainability
- Some regulations require **auditable alerts**.  
- Gen AI outputs are often **difficult to explain or verify**, creating compliance risks.  

### 4. Overreliance on AI
- Sole reliance on AI risks **missing new or evolving threats**.  
- Human oversight is essential to ensure critical escalations aren’t missed.  

---

## Case Example: Rovenia Department of Energy
- Adopted gen AI to **draft insider threat analysis reports** and save analyst time.  
- Poor prompt engineering caused the system to focus only on **internal threats**.  
- Failed to escalate an **external cyberattack** to the National Cybersecurity Coordination Center.  
- Result: **12-hour delay in response**, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data.  

---

## Key Takeaway
Generative AI in cybersecurity must be applied with:  
- **Compliance awareness** (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, transparency laws).  
- **Balanced training data** to reduce bias.  
- **Explainability mechanisms** for audits.  
- **Human oversight** to validate outputs and catch missed threats.
